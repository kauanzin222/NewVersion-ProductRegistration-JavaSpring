# 🎓 Academic Project - Product Registration

This repository contains the source code for my academic project. This project was fundamental for my technical development, allowing me to learn much more about **Java** in general and development best practices.

## 🚀 Key Learnings

During the construction of this project, I highlight the learning in:

- 📦 **Code Organization**: I understood the importance of structuring the project in layers, with special focus on creating and using the **Service Layer** to separate business rules, resulting in cleaner and more organized code.
- 🔄 **Request Mapping**: I learned new REST mapping concepts, implementing **PUT** and **DELETE** methods, in addition to the already known GET and POST.
- 🗄️ **Database**: I performed my first integration with a database using **H2 Console**. Although a simple solution, it was a valuable experience to understand how data persistence works in a Java application.

## 🛠️ How to Access H2 Console

To access the in-memory database console:

1. Start the application.
2. Open your browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`
3. Ensure the **JDBC URL** matches the one in your configuration (e.g., `jdbc:h2:mem:testdb`) and click **Connect**.
